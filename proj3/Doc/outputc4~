Wargaming on a Budget: Gaming Constrained by Money or Space (Paperback)
Wargaming can be a very expensive hobby, but it needn't be. Iain Dickie, one of the best-known names in the hobby shares dozens of hints and tips on how to cut the cost of your gaming and get 'more bang for your buck'. He offers sound practical advice on buying and building your armies (should you opt for metal, plastic, or even card, and in which scale?), gaming tables, terrain, buildings and even storage solutions. As well as purely financial constraints, Iain Dickie also recognizes the fact that available space is another major restriction for many gamers and tackles this issue too. Now you've no excuse not to get wargaming!After 25 years as editor of Miniature Wargames magazine, Iain Dickie is one of the best known names in the hobby. He's even been on the telly, appearing alongside Angela Rippon in Games of War. He has recently retired as editor and intends to spend his time between writing and sailing and, of course, wargaming.

Wargaming on a Budget: Gaming Constrained by Money or Space (Paperback)
Wargaming can be a very expensive hobby, but it needn't be. Iain Dickie, one of the best-known names in the hobby shares dozens of hints and tips on how to cut the cost of your gaming and get 'more bang for your buck'. He offers sound practical advice on buying and building your armies (should you opt for metal, plastic, or even card, and in which scale?), gaming tables, terrain, buildings and even storage solutions. As well as purely financial constraints, Iain Dickie also recognizes the fact that available space is another major restriction for many gamers and tackles this issue too. Now you've no excuse not to get wargaming!After 25 years as editor of Miniature Wargames magazine, Iain Dickie is one of the best known names in the hobby. He's even been on the telly, appearing alongside Angela Rippon in Games of War. He has recently retired as editor and intends to spend his time between writing and sailing and, of course, wargaming.

Wargaming on a Budget: Gaming Constrained by Money or Space (Paperback)
Wargaming can be a very expensive hobby, but it needn't be. Iain Dickie, one of the best-known names in the hobby shares dozens of hints and tips on how to cut the cost of your gaming and get 'more bang for your buck'. He offers sound practical advice on buying and building your armies (should you opt for metal, plastic, or even card, and in which scale?), gaming tables, terrain, buildings and even storage solutions. As well as purely financial constraints, Iain Dickie also recognizes the fact that available space is another major restriction for many gamers and tackles this issue too. Now you've no excuse not to get wargaming!After 25 years as editor of Miniature Wargames magazine, Iain Dickie is one of the best known names in the hobby. He's even been on the telly, appearing alongside Angela Rippon in Games of War. He has recently retired as editor and intends to spend his time between writing and sailing and, of course, wargaming.

Iain Dickie, one of the best-known names in the hobby shares dozens of hints and tips on how to cut the cost of your gaming and get 'more bang for your buck'. He offers sound practical advice on buying and building your armies (should you opt for metal, plastic, or even card, and in which scale?), gaming tables, terrain, buildings and even storage solutions. As well as purely financial constraints, Iain Dickie also recognizes the fact that available space is another major restriction for many gamers and tackles this issue too. Now you've no excuse not to get wargaming!After 25 years as editor of Miniature Wargames magazine, Iain Dickie is one of the best known names in the hobby. He's even been on the telly, appearing alongside Angela Rippon in Games of War. He has recently retired as editor and intends to spend his time between writing and sailing and, of course, wargaming.

The book is a security design manual for embedded systems, the only one of its kind, thought to be a seminal work and controversial in high-level circles because because of the powerful algorithms presented within. The author gets right to providing the crucial do's and don'ts of creating high quality security software that works to prevent all manner of security breaches. The revisions and updates include more than 200 new pages on Vista, Xen, phishing, Google issues, declassified military doctrine, 'Richard Clarke issues,' Skype, mobile fraud, music security issues, antitrust issues, and more.

Wargaming on a Budget: Gaming Constrained by Money or Space (Paperback)
Wargaming can be a very expensive hobby, but it needn't be. Iain Dickie, one of the best-known names in the hobby shares dozens of hints and tips on how to cut the cost of your gaming and get 'more bang for your buck'. He offers sound practical advice on buying and building your armies (should you opt for metal, plastic, or even card, and in which scale?), gaming tables, terrain, buildings and even storage solutions. As well as purely financial constraints, Iain Dickie also recognizes the fact that available space is another major restriction for many gamers and tackles this issue too. Now you've no excuse not to get wargaming!After 25 years as editor of Miniature Wargames magazine, Iain Dickie is one of the best known names in the hobby. He's even been on the telly, appearing alongside Angela Rippon in Games of War. He has recently retired as editor and intends to spend his time between writing and sailing and, of course, wargaming.
